Pegasus Standard is the BSP development kit which helps to build the
Linux kernel, bootloader and root file system for Zilogic's mother
boards from the standard distributions.

== Advantages

The standard distributions like debian, fedora, ubuntu etc., has a lot
of advantages over custom distributions made out of yocto, openwrt,
buildroot etc.,

* Well proven and tested.

* Follows common practices.

* Maintained by dedicated team.
 
* Supports constant upgradation and improvements

* Supports security enhancements and fixes for vulnerabilites

* Less maintenance overhead

* Easier package management

* Easily managed by anyone.

== Pegasus Components

* Make - for build

* Ansible - for package management

== Features

* Builds u-boot, kernel, drivers & managed rootfs

* Designed for multi distro , supports only Debian as of now.

* Designed to support multiple boards, currently supports only
  ZKit-ARM-VF51.

* Can add support for custom code builds.

* Designed support various file system images, currently supports only
  ext4 and tar.

* Planned to support testing in QEMU for sanity.

* Planned to support build statistics for analysis.

== ToDos and Improvements
 
Current design of Pegasus follows heirarchical builds using recursive
makes. Need to improve based on link
http://miller.emu.id.au/pmiller/books/rmch/

== User Instruction

* run below commands to build the BSP. 

----
$make <board>_defconfig
$make
----

== Build Procedure

The Pegasus standard build system, 

* downloads the sources into download folder

* unpacks ans builds the sources into `output/build/package_name`
  folder

* the build outputs required for further builds are placed on
  `staging` folder.

* installs the packages in `output\target` folder which has rootfs
  structure

* the final binary images are places into `output\images` folder
